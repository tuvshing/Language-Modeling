Simple language modeling project

1. Retrieve the top next words and their probability given a bigram prefix.
2. Sampling the next n words given a bigram prefix using the probablity distribution defined by the frequency counts.
3. Generating n-sentences starting with a given sentence prefix. Uses [beam search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) search to generate multiple sentences.
